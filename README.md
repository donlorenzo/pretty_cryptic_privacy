encrypt and decrypt files

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: 
---------------------

This code comes with absolutely no guarantees!  If you use it you do
so at your own risk.  I take no responsibility for data loss,
convictions, death, or anything else.

When considering using a certain cryptography package you have to
assume an adversary with certain capabilities.  The tools you need to
use defending agains an adversary with virtually unlimited resources
(think hostile government) are certainly different from the ones you
might use defending against the prying eyes of your siblings.  While I
do not guarantee anything I would certainly not recommend this package
in the first case but personally find it sufficient in the latter
case.
